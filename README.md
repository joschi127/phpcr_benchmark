# PHPCR Benchmarking

The purpose of this repository is to compare different PHPCR implementations.

Create the database is necessary and make sure to initialize the DB structure when using Doctrine DBAL:
```
composer require jackalope/jackalope-doctrine-dbal:~1.0
./vendor/bin/jackalope jackalope:init:dbal
```

Alternatively when using Jackrabbit download and start the server:
```
composer require jackalope/jackalope-jackrabbit:~1.0
./vendor/bin/jackrabbit.sh
```

Also you can use MongoDB (not available at the moment):
```
composer require jackalope/jackalope-mongodb:*
```

Copy the ``cli-config.php.dist`` or ``cli-config.php.mongo-dist`` for **MongoDB** to ``cli-config.php`` and adjust as needed.
Finally run ``php index.php`` or ``php index.php benchmark``.

It is possible to also configure the number of nodes to add per batch via ``--count`` and the number of
repetitions via ``--sections``.

For example: ``php index.php benchmark --count 4 --sections 7`` (note that no equal sign is supported)

Once the command has been run once, it can optionally be run one more time with ``php index.php benchmark --append``
to add one more "section" on top of the existing data to see how the performance is without having lots of previous
inserts/gets before. This can of course be combined with the other parameters.

Furthermore you can force a table optimization before the test run via ``--optimize``.

Finally it is possible to run some standard jackalope commands via ``./vendor/bin/jackalope``.

## TODO

* Make the stored nodes a bit more complex
* Investigate slow downs (especially insert performance, why SQLite is not using an index for subpath queries, slow downs in get by path)

## Results
